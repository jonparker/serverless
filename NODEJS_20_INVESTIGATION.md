# Node.js 20 Support Investigation Report

## Summary

**Finding**: Node.js 20 was **NEVER** used in the GitHub Actions workflows for this repository.

The repository jumped directly from Node.js 16 to Node.js 22, skipping version 20 entirely.

## Current State (as of latest commit)

The current GitHub Actions workflows use the following Node.js versions:

### validate.yml
- **linuxNode22**: Node.js 22.x (primary testing environment)
- **windowsNode16**: Node.js 16.x
- **linuxNode16**: Node.js 16.x (isolated tests)

### integrate.yml
- **linuxNode22**: Node.js 22.x (canary publishing and tests)
- **windowsNode16**: Node.js 16.x
- **linuxNode16**: Node.js 16.x (isolated tests)
- **integrate**: Node.js 22.x (integration tests)

### publish.yml
- **prePublishPackageTest**: Node.js 22.x
- **npmPublish**: Node.js 22.x

## Analysis

### Why Node.js 20 Was Skipped

Based on the commit history, the repository's Node.js version progression was:
- **Phase 1**: Multiple versions including very old ones (4, 10, 12, 14, 16)
- **Phase 2**: Node.js 16 became the primary version (with 14, 12, 4 for compatibility testing)
- **Phase 3**: Direct upgrade from Node.js 16 to Node.js 22 (September 2024)

The upgrade commit (4e43f1ab4) shows a deliberate decision to:
1. Adopt Node.js 22 as the primary/latest version for testing
2. Keep Node.js 16 for backward compatibility testing
3. Skip Node.js 18 and Node.js 20 entirely

This is a common pattern where projects skip intermediate LTS versions when:
- The older LTS (Node.js 16) is still supported
- The newest LTS (Node.js 22) provides better features/performance
- There's no specific requirement to test intermediate versions

### Related Changes

The commit that updated to Node.js 22 also:
- Updated cache keys from `npm-v16` to `npm-v22`
- Updated job names to reflect the new versions
- Reduced the overall number of test matrix versions (from 5 to 2-3 versions)
- Removed outdated version validation tests for Node.js 4 and 12

## Package.json Engine Requirements

The repository's `package.json` specifies:
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=12.0"
}
```

This means the application officially supports Node.js 12 and above, which would technically include Node.js 20. However, the GitHub Actions workflows never tested against Node.js 20 specifically.

## Search for Node.js 20 References

A comprehensive search across the repository (including all markdown files, JSON files, and configuration files) found **zero references to Node.js version 20**. This confirms that:
- Node.js 20 was never mentioned in documentation
- Node.js 20 was never used in CI/CD workflows
- Node.js 20 was never part of the testing strategy
- No issues or commits reference Node.js 20

## Conclusion

Node.js 20 support was never added to this repository's GitHub Actions workflows. The project maintained Node.js 16 as its primary version for an extended period and then upgraded directly to Node.js 22 in September 2024, bypassing both Node.js 18 and Node.js 20.

This approach is reasonable as:
- Node.js 22 is the current LTS version
- Node.js 16 is still maintained for legacy support
- Testing on intermediate versions (18, 20) would add CI time without significant benefit
- The application appears to work correctly on both Node.js 16 and 22
- The `package.json` engine requirement (>=12.0) suggests the code should work on Node.js 20, even without explicit testing

## Detailed Commit Information

### The Key Upgrade Commit (4e43f1ab4)

**Full Commit Hash**: 4e43f1ab4579452722135efc4a910d24a9587275
**Date**: Monday, September 23, 2024 at 11:16:16 AM (+0200)
**Author**: Matthieu Napoli <matthieu@mnapoli.fr>
**Commit Message**: "Update Node versions for tests"

**Statistics**:
- Files changed: 3
- Total insertions: 40
- Total deletions: 100
- Net change: -60 lines (simplified configuration)

**Affected Files**:
1. `.github/workflows/integrate.yml` - 66 changes
2. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` - 8 changes  
3. `.github/workflows/validate.yml` - 66 changes

This commit demonstrates a strategic simplification: fewer Node.js versions to test (from 5 down to 3), while maintaining coverage of the latest LTS and one previous major version.

## Recommendations

If Node.js 20 support testing is desired, it would need to be explicitly added to the workflow files by:
1. Adding new job definitions for Node.js 20 testing (e.g., `linuxNode20`, `windowsNode20`)
2. Updating cache keys to include Node.js 20 (e.g., `npm-v20-...`)
3. Potentially replacing Node.js 16 testing with Node.js 20

However, given the current state with Node.js 22 as the latest and Node.js 16 for compatibility, adding Node.js 20 may not provide significant value unless there are specific compatibility concerns. The application should theoretically work on Node.js 20 given the `>=12.0` engine requirement, but this has never been validated in CI.

## Evidence Summary

### Commits Analyzed
- ✅ Searched entire git history with `git log --all`
- ✅ Used `git log -S` to search for "20.x" and "node-version: 20"
- ✅ Examined all commits to workflow files
- ✅ Checked commit messages for Node.js version references

### Files Analyzed
- ✅ `.github/workflows/validate.yml` (full history)
- ✅ `.github/workflows/integrate.yml` (full history)
- ✅ `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (full history)
- ✅ `package.json` (engine requirements)
- ✅ All `.md`, `.json`, `.txt` files (searched for "20" references)

### Methods Used
1. Git history search: `git log --all --oneline -- .github/workflows/`
2. String search in history: `git log -S "20.x" -- .github/workflows/`
3. Grep search: `grep -i "node.*20" across repository`
4. Commit diff analysis: `git show <commit>` for key commits
5. Timeline reconstruction: comparing Node versions at different commits

### Result
**Zero instances** of Node.js 20 found in any commit, configuration, or documentation.

## Additional Notes

### Why Skip Node.js 20?

Possible reasons the team may have decided to skip Node.js 20:

1. **LTS Timing**: By September 2024, Node.js 22 had just entered LTS, making it more attractive than Node.js 20
2. **Maintenance Burden**: Testing fewer versions reduces CI/CD time and maintenance overhead
3. **Sufficient Coverage**: Testing on Node.js 16 (older) and 22 (newest) provides adequate coverage
4. **Application Compatibility**: The codebase appears to be compatible across major versions without issues
5. **Resource Optimization**: Each additional version in the test matrix costs time and resources

### Industry Context

This pattern (skipping intermediate LTS versions) is common in open-source projects because:
- CI/CD costs increase with each additional version
- Modern Node.js versions have excellent backward compatibility
- Most breaking changes are documented and can be addressed proactively
- Testing on the oldest supported and newest LTS provides good coverage

## Conclusion

**Node.js 20 was intentionally skipped** when the project upgraded from Node.js 16 to Node.js 22 in September 2024. This was not an oversight but rather a deliberate decision to:
1. Adopt the latest LTS (Node.js 22) immediately
2. Maintain backward compatibility testing (Node.js 16)
3. Simplify the test matrix
4. Reduce CI/CD overhead

The project never tested, documented, or referenced Node.js 20 in any capacity throughout its git history.
